# Gnomock ![Build](https://github.com/orlangure/gnomock/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

Gnomock is a framework to set up temporary docker containers for integration
and end-to-end testing of other applications. It handles pulling images,
starting containers, waiting for them to become available, setting up their
initial state and cleaning up in the end.

It can be used either directly, or via already existing implementations of
various connectors built by the community.

This project is WIP
