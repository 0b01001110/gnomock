## <div align="center">![Build](https://github.com/orlangure/gnomock/workflows/Build/badge.svg) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/orlangure/gnomock)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/orlangure/gnomock)</div>

Gnomock is an integration and end-to-end testing toolkit. It uses Docker to
create **temporary containers** for application dependencies, **setup** their
**initial state** and **clean them up** in the end. Gnomock allows to test the
code with **no mocks** wherever possible.

The power of Gnomock is in a variety of [Presets](#official-presets), each
implementing a specific database, service or other tools. Each preset provides
ways of setting up its initial state as easily as possible: SQL schema
creation, test data upload into S3, sending test events to Splunk, etc.

## Documentation

Gnomock runs locally and exposes an API over HTTP. This API is defined using
OpenAPI 3.0 [specification](./swagger). Go programs can use extended Gnomock
package directly, without HTTP layer, while other languages require
communication with a local server.

### Using Gnomock in Go applications

See package [reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/orlangure/gnomock/gnomock?tab=doc).

For Preset documentation, refer to [Presets](#official-presets) section.

### Using Gnomock in other languages

Gnomock runs as a local server, and any program in any language can communicate
with it using OpenAPI 3.0 [specification](./swagger). Below are some language
specific wrappers for Gnomock API:

- [Python SDK](https://github.com/orlangure/gnomock-python-sdk)
- Javascript SDK
- PHP SDK
- Ruby SDK
- Java SDK
- [Other](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators) languages
